Composition : Instead of inheriting
an ability through inheritance the class is composed
with Objects with the right ability.

Composition allows you to change the capabilities of
 objects at run time!

Decoupling: Encapsulating the concepts/behaviour that varies 

The Stategy pattern lets the algorithm vary independently of clients that use it.

Uses
* It is used when you want to define a class that will have one behaviour that is similar to other behaviours in a list
* When you need to use of several behaviours dynamically
* It often reduces long list of conditionals
* Keeps class changes from forcing other class changes
* It can hide complicated code form the user

One Disadvantages
* Increased number of objects / classes

It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and make them interchangeable
