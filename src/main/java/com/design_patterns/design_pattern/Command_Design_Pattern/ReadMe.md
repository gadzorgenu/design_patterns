The command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to represent and encapsulate all the 
information needed to call a method at a later time

This information includes the method name, object that owns the method and values for the method parameters


- It allows you to store lists of code that is executed at a later time or many times
- An object called the invoker transfers this command to another object called a receiver to execute the right code
