**What is the Abstract Factory Pattern**

* It is like a factory, but everything is encapsulated
* The final objects contain objects that use the Strategy pattern

What can you do with an Abstract Factory?
* Allows you to create families of related objects without specifying a concrete class.
* Use when you have many objects that can be added , or changed dynamically during runtime
* You can model anything you can imagine and have those objects interact through common interfaces

**One Disadvantage**
*They could get complicated


**Each ship takes advantage of polymorphism.
Each ship belongs to the same abstract class to take advantage of polymorphism**

Each ship is made up of parts that has the same abstract class to take advantage of composition
