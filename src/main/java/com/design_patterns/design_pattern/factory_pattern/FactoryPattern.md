  **Uses of the factory pattern**
  * When you don't know ahead of time what class objects you need
  * When all potential classes are in the same subclass hierarchy
  * To centralize class selection code
  * When you don't want the user to have to know every subclass to encapsulate object creation
  * To encapsulate object creation


The factory pattern allows you to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
